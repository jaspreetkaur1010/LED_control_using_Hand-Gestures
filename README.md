# LED_control_using_Hand-Gestures

This project focuses on the integration of gesture recognition and LED control using machine 
learning techniques. The goal is to create a user-friendly system where individuals can 
manipulate LEDs through natural hand gestures. By employing machine learning algorithms 
trained on a diverse dataset of hand gestures, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in 
gesture recognition, enabling seamless interaction with the LED system in real-time. 
Ultimately, the project aims to push the boundaries of human-computer interaction and 
inspire innovation in smart lighting solutions, envisioning a future where technology 
seamlessly integrates into daily life to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.
